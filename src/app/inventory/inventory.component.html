                            Suppliers of IMFS/BEER</h5>

                        <p class="text-slate-400">The requirement of IMFS and Beer is worked out on the first day of
                            every month. The monthly depotwise requirement is worked out by adopting the following
                            procedure.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-2">Weighted average sale per day is arrived at by dividing the total
                            sales with No. of working days during the last three months with weightage being given to
                            the recent sale.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400">The monthly order for IMFS and Beer is generated based on the Weighted
                            average sales per day multiplied by 39 days in the case of local IMFS and 52 days in the
                            case of import IMFS and in case of Beer the Weighted average sale per day is multiplied by
                            39 days.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-2">39 working days in 1 Â½ months and 52 working days and 2 months is
                            taken for calculating the order to be generated, since we need atleast a month's stock to be
                            generated on the first of every month. The extra days is allowed for the transhipment of the
                            stock.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-2">Stock in transit i.e. indent issued but not despatched, goods
                            despatched but not unloaded and the closing balance available at the Depot on the last day
                            of that month will be deducted from the monthly requirement arrived at as per the working
                            mentioned at Point No.(ii) above.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-2"> The net requirement for IMFS will be rounded off to the nearest
                            multiples of 5 and the net requirement for fast moving Beer 650ml/325ml pack will be rounded
                            off to the nearest multiples of 700/600 cases. In respect of slow moving Beer brands the net
                            requirement will be rounded off to the nearest multiples of 50 cases.</p>

                        <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">ISSUE OF INDENTS</h5>
                        <p class="text-slate-400">On 1st of every month the order is generated with all the local
                            manufacturers and import suppliers and indent is regulated in order to have 15 days stock of
                            a particular item in the depots including stock in transit. This ensures that the brand does
                            not go out of stock at any point of time.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-2"> Indents are issued based on the sales closing balance, demand of
                            the fast moving items etc., which is reflected in the daily statement showing depots with
                            'Nil stock' and 'low stock' (inclusive of cumulative stock in Transit) of fast moving items.
                            This statement shows the depots which have NIL stock, 1-3 days stock, 4-7 days stock, 8-10
                            days stock, 11-14 days stock and 15-21 days stock for particular brand and for a particular
                            pack size. Based on the statements, indents are being issued to the suppliers. If a
                            particular brand and pack size is in exceptional demand in the current month and there is a
                            likelihood of stock out situation, then additional order for that particular item is placed
                            and indents issued thereafter.</p>
                        <p class="text-slate-400 mt-2"> After the indents are issued the daily despatches from the
                            suppliers is also being monitored by TASMAC.</p>
